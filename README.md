👋 Hi, I’m Josh Riff  (@jmriff\)

👀 I help pharmaceutical and healthcare companies run SAP. I maximize on-time, in-full orders to customers by
- optimizing warehouse operations, procurement, and planning & MRP
- connecting SAP to parcel shipping companies, such as FedEx, UPS and DHL

💞️ I advise and consult on SAP supply chain logistics for ECC and S/4HANA.  I am using github to support my blogging activities.
